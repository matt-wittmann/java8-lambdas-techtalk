# Lambda Expressions and the Stream API in Java 8
## A Quick Overview

Matt Wittmann

---

# Introduction

* Some functional-programming concepts have been introduced in Java 8
* The lambda-expression syntax was introduced to support the new Stream API
* The Stream API offers an alternative approach to programming: as a series of
  transformations on data

---

# Functional Programming

* Theoretical backing is the lambda calculus, an alternative theory of computation by Alonzo Church
* Often contrasted with imperative programming along with declarative programming more generally
* Java 8 borrows functional concepts but cannot be said to be a functional language

---

# Some Key Concepts in Functional Programming

* **Immutability:** Declared variables do not change.
* **Referential transparency:** An expression can be replaced by the value it results in.
* **First-class functions:** Functions are values like numbers, strings, and objects and can be passed as arguments
  to other functions or returned from other functions.
* **Higher-order functions:** These functions take a function as an argument. These are a powerful abstraction
  in functional programming with some well-known examples being *map*, *filter*, and *reduce*.
* **No side-effects:** Function application does not mutate some implicit global state or environment.

---

# Lambda Expression Syntax

* Java 8 provides some syntactic sugar to represent anonymous functions.
* Under the hood, these are anonymous classes implementing a *functional interface*.
* New type-inferencing bridges the syntactical gap.
* Methods with the appropriate shape can be referenced as functions, too.
* The arrow operator (`->`) is used to separate the parameter list from the function body in a lambda expression.
* For zero arguments, an empty parameter list (`()`) is provided.
* If a lambda expression's function body needs multiple statements, curly braces and semicolons should be used,
  and the `return` expression must be made explicit.

# Example

```
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3 };

// This:

java.util.Arrays.stream(numbers)
    .map(number -> ++number)
    .forEach(System.out::println);

// Is equivalent to:

for (int number : numbers) {
  ++number;
  System.out.println(number);
}
```

---

# Desugaring the Syntax

```
stream.map(number -> ++number);

// Can also be written as:

stream.map(number -> {
  return ++number;
});

// Or as:

stream.map(new IntUnaryOperator() {
  @Override
  public int applyAsInt(int number) {
    return ++number;
  }
});

// It's all just anonymous classes!
```

---

# More on Functional Interfaces

* Any interface with one and only one abstract method is automatically a functional interface
* This can be enforced at compile time with the `@java.lang.FunctionalInterface` annotation
* Many interfaces you know and love from the Java API have been given this annotation like:
  * `java.util.concurrent.Callable`
  * `java.lang.Runnable`
* Java 8 has added numerous new functional interfaces to support a more functional style of programming
  and the Stream API, including specialized versions meant to work with unboxed primitive types
  * `java.util.function.Function`
  * `java.util.function.BiFunction`
  * `java.util.function.IntFunction`
  * `java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator`

# The Stream API

* The killer app for lambda expressions
* An abstraction representing a series of values that can be processed
* Backed by a collection, array, generator, etc.
* "Laziness seeking," as
  [the JavaDocs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html#package.description)
  put it, meaning there is a preference to evaluate only what's needed at the time; this is critical
  for *infinite streams*
* Transformations on underlying values are made using methods implementing common higher-order functions
* Specialized stream types exists to stream the primitive types

---

# Some Higher-Order Functions in the Stream API

* **map:** Transforms each value into another value using a given function.
* **filter:** Returns a substream of elements that match the given predicate.
* **flatMap:** Performs a transformation on the value that yields a stream; all the separate streams are in turn
  flattened into only one stream.
* **reduce:** Takes some identity (baseline) value as a starting point and applies a function to repeatedly reduce
  the stream down to one single value; the function takes two arguments: the current value and the accumulated result.
* **max**, **min:** Finds the maximum and minimum value respectively using the given comparator.
* **forEach:** Does something for each element of the stream. This can be a smell that the code is not closely
  aligned with the functional paradigm as it is inherently relying on a side-effect.
* **collect:** Performs a kind of reduction. This can be used to, for example, transform a stream into a new list
  or other collection type. Several collectors are predefined.
